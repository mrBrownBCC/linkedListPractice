# Linked List Practice

## Overview

This project is designed to help you practice implementing and understanding linked lists in Java. You'll be working through two parts, each focusing on different aspects of linked list operations. The goal is to solidify your understanding of linked lists and their underlying mechanisms, such as adding, deleting, and traversing nodes.

### The Assignment

In this assignment, you'll be tasked with building and extending a linked list in Java, writing various functions to perform operations on the list. The project is split into two parts, each containing a different set of linked list functionalities to implement and test.

### Part 1
Due Tuesday 10/15

In Part 1, you'll implement basic linked list functionality::
- Adding nodes to the head and tail of the list.
- Traversing the linked list and printing the values.
- Checking if a particular value is contained in the linked list.

Test these functionalities using the command provided below to verify your implementation.

### Part 2
Due Monday 10/21
In Part 2, you'll add more advanced operations:
- Deleting nodes by value.
- Calculating the length of the list.

Make sure to test Part 2 to ensure your linked list implementation is complete and correctly handles all sce

### Test Commands
You can run the test commands to validate your implementation:

- **Test Part One**:
  ```sh
  gradle testA
  ```
- **Test Part Two**:
  ```sh
  gradle testB
  ```
- **Run All Tests**:
  ```sh
  gradle testAllGroups
  ```
